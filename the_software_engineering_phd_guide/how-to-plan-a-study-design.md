# How to plan a study design?

A study design helps you debug your own thoughts and to think through the research you plan to do. Writing out a study plan also helps identify the type of research that you would like to do. The guidelines below are to help you get started with your research and is the first step to writing a research paper. I have included a template at the end of the article to act as a prompt for your own study designs. 

## When to write a study design
Study designs save time in the long run as they provide a direction for the research. However, research is non-linear and a plan is only a starting point. Along the way your research is likely to deviate from the initial plan so spend only sufficient time planning for you to know where you are headed. 

## Identify a research problem with your research team
Research is a collaborative effort so the first step is to identify a research problem with your research team. Understanding the literature and topical areas of interest in your research area help identify a problem. A keen interest in the challenges facing our world and how your research area could help solve the problem also helps. Brainstorm multiple ideas and select the most promising problem. During the planning phase aim to complete all sections rather than getting caught up on identifying the perfect problem. 

## Generate beliefs you have about potential solutions
After the problem has been identified, brainstorm potential solutions about the problem and frame these as beliefs. A claim is a belief you have about the world without a thread of evidence. For the claims based on existing papers or anecdotal evidence frame these as hypotheses in a way that can be investigated. 

## Reframe hypotheses and claims as research questions
Rewrite the hypotheses as research questions. Avoid writing research questions that have a yes/no answer. Write research questions that require explanations such as how, why, and under what conditions. You can rewrite these questions later if the research turns out to answer a different research question. 

## Select a methodology suited to your research questions
A research question influences the choice of methodology. For example, a research question such as “How do software engineers perceive the benefits of static analysis tools?” is well suited to a survey where you ask software engineers about their perception rather than an empirical investigation of Github issues. The choice of methodology is also influenced by a) time frames, b) researcher expertise/experience, c) researcher philosophy, and d) effort required. Outline the methodology approach including data analysis techniques and rough sample size. 

## Triangulate your findings using mixed-methods 
In the software engineering field reviewers expect some validation of the findings. For example, if your study involves interviews then consider validating your transcription summaries with the interviewees. One strategy is to use mixed-methods where multiple methodologies are combined. This is done to triangulate findings by identifying multiple sources for the same result. Examples include running a survey followed by an interview to validate results, and surveying practitioners after a systematic mapping study. 

## List the expected contributions from your research
Contributions indicate the outcomes and findings that will add to the existing body of knowledge. Listing out the contributions of your work will help assess the impact of your research and acts as a way to validate your study plan. The outcomes of your research are the concrete artefacts that arise throughout the process in addition to the knowledge you create. In my opinion, the outcomes are what have real impact on the world in software engineering as often these outcomes can be adopted by practitioners i.e. new tools. 

## Scope your research by listing future work and limitations
Plan what you will not do. Research is never completed rather you stop to communicate findings with the community. Future work defines what you will do in the future given more time and favourable results. All research has limitations, what are the limitations of your research? Identifying limitations of your research is part of the scientific process and is expected by the reviewers. A limitation of your research can be addressed by updating the methodology or the research questions. At the planning stage these modifications are cheap to make! Limitations that will not be addressed for various reasons go in the threats to validity section of a paper. 

In conclusion, use a study design to kick start your research and to set a direction. Along the way your plan is going to change so use the planning process as a tool to debug your thinking and to avoid obvious pitfalls.
