# How to run a user evaluation?

Software engineering is a social-technical discipline where the human plays a central role in the craft. During your PhD run your ideas past the intended end user and include their feedback into your work. Consideration of the user is key to be able to have impact on the world around you. 

## Informal vs formal evaluation

Informal evaluations are where you seen input into your research from others in a casual setting. Examples of informal evaluation include a) asking colleagues, b) using heuristics, and c) doing a comparison. Insight from this research is useful for early ideas and short papers. These approaches are less rigours but can still provide guidance on what you should do next. Formal evaluation requires an ethics application and proper study design. These studies involve recuriting participants, running the evaluation, and evaluating the results. During your PhD, at least one formal evaluation is helpful for knowing what is involved and how to ethically engage with research participants. 

## Writing an ethics application

The first step to do a formal user evaluation is to write and submit an ethics application. As a researcher you are responsible for ensuring that your research is conducted in an ethical manner and considers the privacy of your participants. Ethical considerations include how you treat participants and management of their data. Treat the process as a risk mitgation strategy which is intended to protect you from unethical findings. 

## Test your assumptions with real people

Break down the solo nature of a PhD by interacting with others. As you increase your understanding of the field you will need to test ideas with people to ensure you are still on track. Assumptions can be validated with your supervisor panel, discussed with your colleagues and online discussion through blogs, social media, and forums. Allow for assumptions to be incorrect and course correct as you hone in on the solution you are after. Research is presented in a linear manner which is missleading; research is a series of ups and downs. Allow for failure in your ideas and concepts. 

## Provide value to your participants

Participants have offered their time to you so ensure that you have value to offer them. One way to do this is to circulate your findings with all participants once you have done. Remember to summarise your findings for a general audience and highlight how the knowled you have discovered benefits them. When designing your studies consider what outcomes you can produce for the benefit of the participants. Ideas include a) checklist, b) template, c) tool, or d) insight.
