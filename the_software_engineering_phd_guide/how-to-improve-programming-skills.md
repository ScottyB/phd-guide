# How to improve programming skills?

A PhD is an opportunity to develop deep technical skills in a single area. I prefer to provide PhD students with opportunities to improve both their programming skills and their data science skills. For the purpose of this article I define programming as skills to help you be a better software engineer and data science as skills to help discover knowledge from data more effectively. Done right, the PhD is also an opportunity to create a portfolio of your work. 

## Create a solution first mindset through rapid prototyping

Software developed as part of a PhD is primarily to evaluate a concept or to demonstrate the feasibility. During your PhD being able to rapidly explore multiple ideas and approaches helps refine your thought process. These skills are also helpful in exploratory software engineering where the best way to come up with a solution is unknown. For example, at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute we create prototypes for companies and often are unsure of the best technology stacks to use. We run a series of spikes to explore multiple iterations ensuring to test only the core features in the least amount of time as possible. Your PhD is a good time to develop this approach. Not all prototypes require code, low-code and no-code tools (think excel) are excellent approaches for some solutions. 

The quality of the code is of secondary importance during your PhD. As you learn more about the ideal solution you can incrementally refine the software artefacts. I recommend improving the quality of your prototypes as a break from thesis writing towards the end of your PhD. That said, be aware that the quality of the code you produce is not industry grade and is likely to require multiple iterations to improve. 

**I probably need to think of some guidelines here that clarify the amount of effort to put into code quality**

## Find answers from data by defining the questions upfront

Empirical software engineering is perfect for developing data science skills. The discipline and the methodology for finding answers to questions is transferable to industry projects. During your PhD you will have specific questions that need to be answered from surveys, interviews or repositories. To do this effectively the questions need to be defined up front, the analysis techniques decided, the metrics selected, and a method to follow defined. Ensure that you follow a similar process when working on client problems. Data science work has the potential to be a massive time sink, there are always new questions or new analysis techniques to try. Ensure that you keep the solution first mindset front and center when diving into data. 

## Gain frequent feedback from participants and colleagues

Feedback plays an important part of your PhD. Embrace feedback, both positive and negative. The best thing about feedback is that it does not have to be actioned, although avoiding all feedback is also foolish. Feedback can help steer the direction of your research towards a solution that is beneficial to practitioners and help you come up with ideas that you hadn't considered. Discuss ideas with other PhD students to see how their ideas influence your project. This is a great way to build a network and to get into the habit of creative discussions. The key is to get feedback on ideas. 

## Opensource all scripts and prototypes 

I recommend publishing all scripts and prototypes developed during your PhD. A growing trend in software engineering research is to include artefacts used in research papers including scripts and tool prototypes. Opensourcing your prototypes enables other researchers to build on top of your ideas and to extend your work. Of course this requires a little attention to detail to ensure that your code runs and matches what was claimed in paper. For all papers I recommend setting up a git repository for data and scripts. Follow a set of conventions for your research to ensure that your work can be reproducible. [Surround](http://github.com/a2i2/surround) is a framework that we built for helping move research prototypes into production ready system. The main purpose is to enable the evaluation of new ideas in production as with AI solutions the efficacy of an approach cannot be determined offline and must be evaluated in the context of use. 

A PhD, in Australia, runs for approximately 3 years. A hard working student can gain experience in research, programming and data science. Enjoy this time of learning and use your skills for the improvement of society.
